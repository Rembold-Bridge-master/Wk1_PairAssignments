# Problem 1: Tricky Multiples

This first problem is to get some practice with looping and numeric boolean expressions. Your objective is to write a program that only prints numbers to the screen which are divisible by _either_ 6 _or_ 7, but **not both**. The starting template has two defined variables at the top called `MIN_NUMBER` and `MAX_NUMBER` which represent the minimum and maximum values that you should be checking in between (go ahead and include _both_ endpoints in your check) and printing off the numbers if they meet the desired condition.

Initially just print off one number on each line. Once you have that working though, modify the code so that it prints out a single line of numbers, where each number is separated from the next by a comma and a space.
